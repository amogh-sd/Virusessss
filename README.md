# Virusessss

This repository contains some of the .bat files is created. They, are kind of viruses. But please do not misuse them. They are meant for educational purpose. You can see the code which is written in them, and learn how they were created. I am surely gonna add more of them. If I was you, i would prefer not to open some of the file on your own device...

# WARNING! THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN MADE BY ME, ONLY FOR OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH FILES WORK, IN SHORT, THIS IS FOR "EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE" ONLY
ALSO, PLEASE OPEN ANY OF THE FILE PRESENT HERE, AT YOUR OWN RISKS, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY  OF THE CRAZY STUFF WHICH "MIGHT" HAPPEN TO YOUR DEVICES!

WELL... AND, ACTUALLY, WRITING THE ABOVE LINE WAS PRETTY USELESS, SINCE ALMOST NO ONE IS GONNA DOWNLOAD ANY OF THE FILES PRESENT HERE, JUST BECUASE THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE VIRUS FILES, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE MENTIONED A MILLION TIMES, THAT THOSE VIRUSES ONLY WORK WHEN YOU OPEN THOSE FILES!!!

And, yes, i am also adding an antivirus, for the "virusTry.bat" file. the way it works, is, you are supposed to click on the antivirus file, if you accidently click on vrusTry... to prevent you device from shutting down. So, keep the both file at the same loction(that's what smart people would do!)... But, still, as i said, "virusTry.bat" is not at all harmful, if not used TOO MUCH. trust me, i myself openned it on my own device more than 5 times, and, all fine!

I have recently added some more virus files to this repository... trust me, they can scare the shit out of you, but all you need to override them, is one simple click, or a sinple restart here and there, and you are all set.
