# Virusessss

This repository contains some of the .bat files is created. They, are kind of viruses. But please do not misuse them. They are meant for educational purpose. You can see the code which is written in them, and learn how they were created. I am surely gonna add more of them. If I was you, i would prefer not to open some of the file on your own device...

And, yes, i am also adding an antivirus, for the "virusTry.bat" file. the way it works, is, you are supposed to click on the antivirus file, if you accidently click on vrusTry... to prevent you device from shutting down. So, keep the both file at the same loction(that's what smart people would do!)... But, still, as i said, "virusTry.bat" is not at all harmful, if not used TOO MUCH. trust me, i myself openned it on my own device more than 5 times, and, all fine!
