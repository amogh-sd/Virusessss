# Virusessss

This repository contains some of the .bat files is created. They, are kind of viruses. But please do not misuse them. They are meant for educational purpose. You can see the code which is written in them, and learn how they were created. I am surely gonna add more of them. If I was you, i would prefer not to open some of the file on your own device...

# WARNING! THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN MADE BY ME, ONLY FOR OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH FILES WORK, IN SHORT, THIS IS FOR "EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE" ONLY
ALSO, PLEASE OPEN ANY OF THE FILE PRESENT HERE, AT YOUR OWN RISKS, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY  OF THE CRAZY STUFF WHICH "MIGHT" HAPPEN TO YOUR DEVICES!

WELL... AND, ACTUALLY, WRITING THE ABOVE LINE WAS PRETTY USELESS, SINCE ALMOST NO ONE IS GONNA DOWNLOAD ANY OF THE FILES PRESENT HERE, JUST BECUASE THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE VIRUS FILES, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE MENTIONED A MILLION TIMES, THAT THOSE VIRUSES ONLY WORK WHEN YOU OPEN THOSE FILES!!!

So anyway, I am also adding an antivirus, for the "virusTry.bat" file. the way it works, is, you are supposed to click on the antivirus file, if you accidently click on vrusTry... to prevent you device from shutting down. So, keep the both file at the same loction(that's what smart people would do!)... But, still, as i said, "virusTry.bat" is not at all harmful, if not used TOO MUCH. trust me, i myself openned it on my own device more than 5 times, and, all fine!

I have posted some codes that i have written, as VBS or Batch files.... and.. well, they are viruses. 
But do not worry, the viruses dont act unless and until YOU DOWNLOAD THEM AND OPEN THEM ON YOUR DEVICES, NOT ON THIS SITE

"SOME" OF THE FILES "MAY" HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HARM YOUR DEVICE, AND I REPEAT AND AM WILLING TO DO SO A MILLION TIMES, THAT I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE ANY HARM THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOUR COMPUTER

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE ANY HARM THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOUR COMPUTER

Please OPEN THOSE FILES ON YOUR DEVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK
I WILL PROVIDE A LIST OF THE VIRUS FILES(along with their extensions) THAT ARENT DIRECTLY HARMFUL TO YOUR COMPUTER ALONG WITH THEIR OVERRIDE OPTIONS, IF ANY.


I have recently added some more virus files to this repository... trust me, they can scare the shit out of you, but all you need to override them, is one simple click, or a sinple restart here and there, and you are all set.

Umm... well, ok.. now... I have added a few files, which, MIGHT have the potential to completely ruin your device! 
So... be careful, read the names of the files carefully, some of them consist of number and "levels", and trust me, as the level increases, the capacity of the virus increases, so, i would recommend you all, to please, use these files, only for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

Even though i have not tested any of them yet, on my own device(since i am not a total idiot), please be careful, before you play around with any of them.

# List Of File, and their override options, IF ANY!

NAME                  EXTENSION                   OVERRIDE OPTIONS 

virusTry              .bat                        Click on "antivirus.bat" within less than 5 seconds
virusLevel2           .bat                        Click on "virusTry.bat" while you can, or simply shutdown/restart the device. Even if you do none of them, your OS is likely to                                                   detect that it is a virus, and restart itself
newVirus3             .vbs                        Press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL >then> Sign Out, and restart.
autoType              .vbs                        Same as newVirus3.vbs
errorMsg              .vbs                        No need of one... it's not even a virus
loop                  .bat                        No need of one... it's not even a virus
wormy                 .bat                        *It will creat two folders on your device: one of them at the location they are ceated and other one, in your startup folder*                                                     so you need to locate them, and delete them...(antually, this override is not accurate, but i have told the main thing, so you                                                   can be safe from this worm, if you follow these instructions, just keep in mind that, you may not see everything as expected,                                                     so delete all the suspecting files and folders)
virusLEVEL4           .bat                        None, which i know of, you can try to shutdown or restart your device, but most probably it wont work, so i would suggest you                                                     to test this on a spare device or something.. InFact, i myself have not tested it(since i dont want to take a risk), but you                                                     can try it on a spare device for sure... and also, please be sure to tell me how it works, PLEASE,  IT IS A REQUEST
virusLevel5           .bat                        It is a matter of common sense that, sonce I don't know an override options for the virusLEVEL4 itself, how am i supposed to                                                     know an override option for a much developed virus than it? But still, IF ANYONE MANAGES TO FIND OUT MORE OVERRISE OPTIONS FOR                                                   ANY OF THESE FILES, PLEASE LET ME KNOW..
